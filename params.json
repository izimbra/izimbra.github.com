The primary motivation is the need to share knowledge, which I see as a step in my quest for becoming a [software craftsman](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org).\r\n\r\nI need to share what I learn for 2 simple reasons:\r\n* in order not to forget it\r\n* trying to explain things to others shows there's more to be learned.  \r\nSo basically this is going to be a *programming* blog, because this is what I'm _really_ interested in and trying to do for a living. At the same time, I feel that my skills are _really_ underdeveloped, especially when I read about young hackers creating fantastic software. I'm not that young (programming is my second career) and way far from daring to put the word _hacker_ anywhere near me, but why not help this by [exposing my ignorance](http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596518387/emptying_the_cup.html#expose_your_ignorance)?\r\n\r\nBesides this main reason - _I want to be a great programmer_ - I also want to be a more fluent, faster and better-styled writer (in that order). And how do I get to Carnegie Hall?\r\n\r\nI will try writing texts here in the way I myself expect from a good technical reading:\r\n* to the point but with enough detail\r\n* with relevant references and good layout\r\n* and a bit of humour sometimes.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if I will put any personal information here, but at least I'm gonna say that my nickname is the anagram of my full name (the first being Eugene). I picked that up from another guy's programming blog :)\r\n\r\n### What+\r\n\r\nThere's another topic very dear to me, and which I feel much more comfortable talking about - *music*.  \r\nI consider myself a rather passionate _vinyl_ collector\r\n\r\n### How"}
