        <h2>I Started a Blog</h2>

<p><em>Date: 21 Jan 2013</em><br><em>Music: Low - I Started a Joke</em></p>

<h3>What and Why</h3>

<p>I wanted to start blogging for some time now, and here comes my first shot at it. The primary motivation is the need to share knowledge, which I see as a step in my quest for becoming a <a href="http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org">software craftsman</a>.</p>

<p>I need to share what I learn for 2 simple reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>in order not to forget it</li>
<li>trying to explain things to others shows there's more to be learned.<br>
So basically this is going to be a <em>programming</em> blog, because this is what I'm <em>really</em> interested in and trying to do for a living. At the same time, I feel that my skills are <em>really</em> underdeveloped, especially when I read about young hackers creating fantastic software. I'm not that young (programming is my second career) and way far from daring to put the word <em>hacker</em> anywhere near me, but why not help this by <a href="http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596518387/emptying_the_cup.html#expose_your_ignorance">exposing my ignorance</a>?</li>
</ul><p>Besides this main reason - <em>I want to be a great programmer</em> - I also want to be a more fluent, faster and better-styled writer (in that order). And how do I get to Carnegie Hall?</p>

<p>I will try writing texts here in the way I myself expect from a good technical reading:</p>

<ul>
<li>to the point but with enough detail</li>
<li>with relevant references and good layout</li>
<li>and a bit of humour sometimes.</li>
</ul><p>I'm not sure if I will put any personal information here, but at least I'm gonna say that my nickname is the anagram of my full name (the first being Eugene). I picked that up from another guy's programming blog :)</p>

<h3>What+</h3>

<p>There's another topic very dear to me, and which I feel much more comfortable talking about - <em>music</em>.<br>
I consider myself a rather passionate <em>vinyl</em> collector</p>
